  "architecture": "The application will follow a client-server architecture. The frontend, built with Next.js (Page Router), React, and TailwindCSS, will handle all UI rendering and client-side game logic for local play (Player vs. AI). Real-time multiplayer and potentially other dynamic features will communicate with backend API routes (Next.js API routes) primarily using WebSockets for live updates and REST API for data persistence (user profiles, game history, leaderboards). Chess game logic will be encapsulated in a shared utility library. A simple AI will run client-side for player-vs-AI mode.",

  "dataFlow": "Client-side: User interactions (piece drags, button clicks) update local React state. This state is then used by the Chessboard component to re-render the UI. For Player vs. AI games, the AI logic directly modifies the local game state.Server-side (conceptual for blueprint): For multiplayer, client-side game state changes are sent via WebSockets to the server. The server validates moves, updates game state, and broadcasts updates to all connected clients in the same game. User profile data, ratings, leaderboards, puzzle data, and openings data are fetched from and persisted via REST API endpoints.",
  "description": "A full-fledged, responsive, and visually striking chess website designed with a nostalgic 'Retro' aesthetic, mimicking the polish and feature set of platforms like Chess.com.The application will allow users to play chess against a simple AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels. It will also support real-time multiplayer matches with custom timers and in-game text chat for a lively social experience. Beyond core gameplay, the platform will feature an analysis board for reviewing past games, a curated set of chess puzzles to hone tactical skills, an openings explorer for strategic study, user rating display, and global leaderboards to foster competitive engagement. User profiles will offer a personalized space for tracking progress and stats. The design will emphasize early-internet graphics, pixel art elements, and neon aesthetics to evoke a distinct 90s/early 2000s web culture feel.",

    "uiDesign": "The UI will embody a 'Retro' aesthetic, drawing heavily from early-internet graphics, pixel art, subtle 3D effects, and occasional glitch accents. The color palette will be dominated by vibrant neon hues: Electric Blue (#00FFFF) for primary highlights, Cyber Pink (#FF00FF) for secondary actions and accents, and Electric Yellow (#FFFF00) for focus states and interactive elements. The background will be a deep, rich Deep Violet (#1A0A33), often with subtle grainy textures or a faint grid pattern to evoke an old CRT screen. Text will be Off-white (#E0E0E0) for readability. Typography will feature 'Press Start 2P' for bold headings, titles, and button text, providing a distinct pixelated feel, complemented by 'VT323' for body text and monospaced elements, reminiscent of terminal interfaces. UI elements like buttons will have a chunky, 'beveled' appearance with prominent neon borders and subtle box shadows (e.g., 'shadow-[4px_4px_0_0_#FFFF00]') that shift on hover. Input fields will have dark backgrounds with neon outlines. Panels and containers will often feature semi-transparent dark backgrounds with glowing neon borders. Animations, powered by Framer Motion, will be quick, snappy, and may incorporate subtle 'glitch' effects, 'scanline' overlays during transitions, or a classic 'CRT flicker' on element interactions. The chessboard itself will have starkly contrasting light (Electric Blue) and dark (Deep Violet) squares, with selected squares and valid moves highlighted by a bright Electric Yellow glow or Cyber Pink markers. Pieces will be stylized as simple, iconic pixel art or low-poly 3D shapes.",
    "uiLayout": "The application layout will be highly responsive, adapting seamlessly from mobile phones to large desktop displays. It will feature a sticky 'Header' at the top, containing the main application title/logo (left) and primary navigation links (right). On smaller screens, these links will collapse into a hamburger menu. The central 'Content Area' will dynamically display different sections of the application (e.g., Chess Game, Puzzles, Openings, Leaderboards, Profile). For the main game view, the 'Chessboard' will be centrally located, with 'Game Controls' (New Game, Undo, etc.) and 'Game Info' (turn indicator, timer, chat) arranged around it. On desktop, these side panels will be adjacent to the board, while on mobile, they will collapse below or above the board, often in tabbed or scrollable sections. A 'Footer' will be present at the bottom of every page, containing minimal copyright information. Sections like Puzzles and Openings will utilize a grid-based layout for content display, ensuring clear organization and readability. User profiles will follow a clean column layout with responsive wrapping for stats and game history.",
    "userJourney": "1. **Landing Page:** User lands on the home page, greeted by a 'Retro' themed welcome and a prominent 'Play AI' button. Navigation links to 'Multiplayer', 'Puzzles', 'Openings', 'Leaderboards', and 'Profile' are visible in the header.2. **Play vs. AI:** Clicking 'Play AI' (or being on the default home page tab) brings up the interactive chessboard. The user can select a difficulty level (initially very basic, then expanded). They play against the AI, making moves by dragging pieces. Game controls (new game, reset) are available.3. **Exploring Other Features (Placeholders):** Clicking 'Multiplayer', 'Puzzles', 'Openings', 'Leaderboards', or 'Profile' from the header navigates to a placeholder page for that feature, informing the user it's 'Coming Soon' with retro styling.4. **Real-time Multiplayer (Phase 2):** User clicks 'Multiplayer'. They can view a lobby of available games or create a new one, setting parameters like timer. Once in a game, they see the chessboard, opponent's name, timer, and an in-game text chat. Moves are synchronized in real-time.5. **Feature Expansion (Phase 2+):** Users can access an 'Openings Explorer' to browse common chess openings with moves. 'Puzzles' presents tactical positions for the user to solve. 'Leaderboards' displays top players by rating. 'Profile' shows user stats, game history, and allows basic customization. The 'Analysis Board' allows replaying and analyzing past games."
